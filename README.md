# Express Portfolio

View the demo [here](# I will add a link for live demo when it will be ready!#).

This portfolio website showcases the projects that I have built. A JSON file stores all the data about the projects. Pug is used to create templates that utilize the JSON to generate markup that is displayed in the browser. Express is used to import the required dependencies, link JSON with the Pug templates, set up routes to handle requests, set up middleware to utilize static files, handle errors, and set up a server to serve the project. This project was created for the purpose of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
